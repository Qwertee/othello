# Othello
Simple clone of the othello (or reversi) game.

### build
you need to have the Allegro library somewhere accessible on your system.

from the root of the project run `mkdir build`, `cd build`, and finally `cmake ..` to generate a make file
in the build directory. The make file generates an executable in the bin directory of the root of the project.
